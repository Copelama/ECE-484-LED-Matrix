This project interfaces an LED-Matrix on an Arduino Uno. The main programs (library and code) are in C, while the compiling script is written in Python. 

**Introduction:** 
An LED-Matrix is an array of LEDs that can be controlled individually. This project is set up to use the HiLetGo MAX7219 LED-Matrix
