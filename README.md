# Project Description:

This project interfaces an LED-Matrix on an Arduino Uno. The main programs (library and code) are in C, while the compiling script is written in Python. 

## Introduction:

An LED-Matrix is an array of LEDs that can be controlled individually. This project is set up to use the HiLetGo MAX7219 LED-Matrix. It works by sending a column and row value and a high or low (1 or 0) signal to the device, turning that LED on. 

## Materials:

- Arduino Uno R3
- Jumper Wires
- HiLetGo MAX7219 LED-Matrix
